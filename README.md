# Using YouTube topic discovery and textual analysis to understand sub-topics within the "Slime" trend. 
 
This project uncovers the latent topics in YouTube videos related to the search query "Slime". 

It begins with a keyword and collocate textual analysis exploration of the dataset in order to discern the main themes within the corpus. It then explores the utility of three models for arranging videos topically: 

* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic modelling 
* K-means cluster model
* Hierarchical cluster model

# Motivation 

Many studies have explored the value in topic modelling methods for the sake of optimising user journeys on the YouTube platform. However, there are few studies which apply these techniques from a social research perspective. Therefore this study aims to explore the potential for using YouTube textual data in order to understand the topical and thematic consititution of a YouTube trend as a social phenomenon. 

# Data 

Data scraped from YouTube using the [Digital Methods Institute's YouTube Tool] (https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ToolYouTubeDataTools) based on the search query "Slime".
